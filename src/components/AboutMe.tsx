                Hi, my name is Owen and I am a full stack software developer. In
                my professional life, I am skilled in a variety of programming
                languages and tools such as Go, JavaScript, React, SQL, and Git.
                As a developer, I am always looking to learn and expand my
                skillset. In my personal life, I am passionate about staying
                active and healthy. Some of my hobbies include martial arts,
                running, and overall fitness. I also enjoy drawing and creating
                art in my free time. Overall, I am a well-rounded individual
                with a love for both my profession and personal interests. I am
                always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn, both
                personally and professionally.
